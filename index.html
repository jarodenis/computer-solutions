                     worms and spyware. Despite improvements in anti-virus and anti-malware software, identity theft 
                     and hackers pose a greater threat than ever.
                     Unless your computer and network security are completely up-to-date, security compromises are 
                     highly likely.  This is especially true when several members of the same household are using 
                     social networking sites.
                     If you suspect your computer has a problem or even a threat resulting from a security breach, 
                     it is important to contact Computer Solutions as soon as possible. Our experts have the most 
                     up-to-date and most sophisticated anti-virus software.</b>

                    <b>Often the technicians will run through a typical set of software diagnostics that may or may 
                    not lead to a favourable outcome. If the outcome is unfavourable they may suggest a computer 
                    repair store that will waste even more of your precious time or they might make a recommendation 
                    that points you in the direction of a new computer.
                    Other retail outlets that have dedicated repair centres often send your computer to a central 
                    repair location that is often far (out of state) from the store that you brought your computer to. 
                    Not only do you run the risk of having your computer and data lost in the mail, but these repairs 
                    are typically expensive and may again lead to a recommendation to purchase a new computer.</b>

                    <b>There has been a dramatic shift in the way residences and small businesses interconnect computers 
                    within relatively close areas. It’s not just computer to computer through a central signal any longer, 
                    but can include hand-held tablet computers to home entertainment centres or security systems; several 
                    computers to printers or copiers or even computers to home lighting or music.
                    The network that allows wireless internet interconnectivity within a local area, or “LAN,” takes 
                    advantage of a wireless router or wireless access point.
                    While the wireless interconnectivity technology offers an amazing array of technical solutions 
                    to everyday problems, it is not fool-proof and may require expertise in its set-up and trouble-shooting.</b>
